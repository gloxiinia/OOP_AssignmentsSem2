Good day Everyone!


Welcome to this week's forum discussion. I encourage everyone to be pro-active in the thread, share snippets of your solutions, 
if you encounter an obstacle in solving a problem, raise your questions and "hopefully" someone will help/assist/guide you in the process.


Have fun!


Machine Problem 1. Write a program called PrintArray which prompts user for the number of items in an array (a non-negative integer) and 
saves it in an int variable called NUM_ITEMS. It then prompts user for the values of all the items and saves them in an int array called items. 
The program shall then print the contents of the array in the form of [x1, x2, ..., xn].

          Sample:

                       Enter the number of items: 5

                       Enter the value of all items (separated by space): 3 2 5 6 9

                       The values are: [3, 2, 5, 6, 9]

 

Machine Problem 2. Write a program called printArrayInStars which prompts user for the number of items in an array (a non-negative integer) and 
saves it in an int variable called NUM_ITEMS. It then prompts user for the values of all the items (non-negative integers) and saves them in an 
int array called items. The program shall then print the contents of the array in a graphical form, with the array index and values represented by number of stars.

           Sample:

                       Enter the number of items: 5

Enter the value of all items (separated by space): 7 4 3 0 7

 

0: *******(7)

1: ****(4)

2: ***(3)

3: (0)

4: *******(7)

 

Machine Problem 3. Write a program which prompts user for the number of students in a class (a non-negative integer) and saves it in an int variable 
called numStudents. It then prompts user for the grade of each of the students (integer between 0 to 100) and saves them in an int array called grades. 
 The program shall then compute and print the average (in double rounded to 2 decimal places) and minimum/maximum (in int).

           Sample:

Enter the number of students: 5

Enter the grade for student 1: 98

Enter the grade for student 2: 78

Enter the grade for student 3: 78

Enter the grade for student 4: 87

Enter the grade for student 5: 76

The average is: 83.40

The minimum is: 76

The maximum is: 98
